# Stroke Image Processing Funhouse

This repository will contain the collection of image processing pipelines that are widely used in stroke research.

The goal of this project is to provide the end-to-end image processing AI/ML pipeline of stroke image processing that can be used without the deep understanding of AI/ML. The pipeline will include: 

- Acute Lesion Segmentation with DWIs 

- White Matter Hyperintensity Segmentation with T2 FLAIR Images

- Spatial Matching of DWIs/FLAIRs to Brain Territories/Regions

- And more to come! 


The framework is powered by the MONAI framework (https://monai.io). 

# Note 

This git is actively under development. We will add appropriate references when it goes public.

# Current Development (10/07/2021) 

Currently testing/developing acute lesion segmentation framework with DWIs.
